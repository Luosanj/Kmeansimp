## Overview
* This package is an improved version of standard kmeans clustering which is Lloyd algorithm. The main improved part is initial centroids sampling. 
* Standard sampling method is to randomly select k points( k is number of clusters) as initial centroids. Yet this way usually converges too slow. The improved 
version has 3 steps:
   * Step 1: From all objects randomly select one. 
   * Step 2: select next initial centroids from n-objects in such a way that the Euclidean distance
of that object is maximum from other selected initial centroids.
   * Step 3: repeat step 2 until we get k initial centroids. <br>
 * From these steps we will get initial centroids and with these initial centroids to perform kMeans algorithm. <br>
 * You can learn more about them in *Tutorial.html* in vignette folder.

## Backend
* The improvement idea is from [here](https://www.ijcsmc.com/docs/papers/July2013/V2I7201338.pdf) but including some changes.
----

## installation
* install.packages('Kmeansimp')
